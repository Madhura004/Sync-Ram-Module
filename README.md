# Sync-Ram-Module
## Simple Synchronous of RAM Module with read & write operations : This repository contains the implementation of a simple synchronous RAM (Random Access Memory) module in Verilog. The module supports both read and write operations
## NAME : MADHURA MAHESH PAWAR
## COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT.LTD
## ID : CT08FEE
## DOMAIN : VLSI
## MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR 
## FEATURES: Clock Synchronous Design All operations are performed in synchronous with a clock signal.
## STEPS INVOLVED:
1.Source code for the RAM module.
2.Testbench code to validate the module functionality.
3.Supporting scripts for simulation and synthesis 
## TESTING : 
Read and write operations.
